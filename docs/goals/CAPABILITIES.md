# Capabilities — the loop's only success metric

Append-only inventory of **real, user-exercisable** Muse
capabilities. One line per capability: what the user can do, the
exact command/surface, and the executable check that proves it.

Rules (enforced by `.claude/rules/iteration-loop.md`):

- Every shipped outward goal MUST append exactly one new line here.
  The `<check>` MUST be a concrete automated test or smoke id that
  actually runs green under `pnpm check` / `pnpm smoke:broad` /
  `pnpm smoke:live` and asserts the *capability* end-to-end (not
  that code compiles). Prose with no runnable id is not a check.
- **Cross-time falsification:** every iteration's first action is
  to run the newest line's check and prove it still passes. A
  faked/broken line = the next iteration's whole job is to fix it.
- **Regression sweep:** every 10th iteration re-runs ALL checks;
  any regression = next iteration must restore it.
- Append-only. Never delete or weaken a line.
- **Line count = the loop's only success metric.** Not strictly
  increased across the last 5 iterations ⇒ next iteration's sole
  mandate is one real capability + check. Flat = degeneration; act
  on it — never stop, never ask a human.
