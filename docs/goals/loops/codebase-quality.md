# Loop journal — `codebase-quality`

Theme: continuously raise Muse's internal code quality to top OSS standard —
decompose god-files, cohere scattered responsibility, recompose seams, remove
dead code, comment hygiene, and continue the in-flight `@muse/recall` extraction
(`commands-ask.ts` → `runGroundedRecall`). Tier1 (local commits on branch
`codebase-quality`, never push, never auto-merge to main). Worktree
`/tmp/muse-codebase-quality`. Cron `81ac643b` (every 15m, session-only).

- **What:** moved the three PURE recall decision helpers — `shouldSuggestRepair`,
  `shouldWarnStrippedCitations`, `suggestOptInSource` (+ private GIT_INTENT_RE /
  SHELL_INTENT_RE) — out of `commands-ask.ts` into `@muse/recall/text.ts`; CLI
  imports + re-exports them (transitional). Added package tests for all three.
- **Why:** continues the @muse/recall extraction (project_recall_extraction
  "model-backed wrappers" cluster — the PURE subset; the truly model-backed
  `drawBestGroundedRedraft`/`groundingVerdictNotice` stay for a design slice).
  commands-ask.ts 2,994 → 2,940 LOC.
- **Review point:** behavior-preserving move; an independent Opus adversarial
  judge confirmed byte-identical bodies, intact call sites (lines 2481/2512/2694),
  no orphan const refs, slice touches exactly 3 files, grounding floor unchanged.
- **Risk:** none material — pure helpers, re-export keeps call sites/tests green.
  Remaining recall TODO: model-backed wrappers (design), weakness ledger, graph
  connections, then Phase 3 pipeline + API.
